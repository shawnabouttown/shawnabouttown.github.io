     <h1 id="whatscooking-header">Making stews with left-overs</h1>
     <p>Do you often buy one or more of those rotisserie chickens that are so convenient? They come cooked in different seasonings so you can change it up now and then, or my favorite is the unseasoned rotisserie. This I can share with my pups, and they take it with mashed peas. It's their favorite. It's my favorite. But wait, this is about stews, left-over stews.</p>
     <p>Here's the deal. After I've carved out most of the white meat, and most of the dark meat, there're all these bones left over (imagine several containers together), with little pockets of dark meat still on them. I just throw them in a large pot, add some vegetables (onions, carrots, radishes, winter melon, cucumber, ginger root, or whatever you have on hand), and some seasonings (Mrs. Dash, or soy sauce as I like to use), boil, and then simmer for a few hours!</p>
  <p>And there you have it, a great, comforting chicken stew. Perfect for any day of the week, any month of the year, and especially during the colder days.</p>
